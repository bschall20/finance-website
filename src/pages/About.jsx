          To make the world of finances easier to navigate and keep money in
          your hands. At Build My Finance, we believe the best way to view your
          money, is to see your money. Visualizing where you spend your money at
          and what you spend it on can help to provide a better understanding of
          where you may want to, or not want to, spend your hard earned cash.
